# Security Assessment - Version 0.1

# Tested Exploits

### Buffer Overflow Attack
**File:** `exploits/overflow_attack.c`
**Payload Size:** 10MB continuous data (no newlines)
**Server Behavior:** Stopped responding after recieving 12.5MB
**Failure Point:** The server's `recv()` loop does not respect buffer boundaries when searching for newline terminators
**Impact Confirmed:** Denial of Service achieved
**Fix Required:** Implement length-prefixed messaging.

### Command Injection (CWE-77)
**File:** `exploits/injection_attack.py`
**Vulnerability:** The protocol uses in-band signaling (newlines) for both data and command separation.
**Impact:** Spoofing, unauthorized actions, protocol violation.
**Fix Required:** Use a binary protocol with type-length-value (TLV) formatting.


### Input Parsing Crash (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)
**File:** `exploits/injection_attack.py`
**Vulnerability:** The server's command parsing logic lacks proper input validation and error handling.
**Impact:** Malformed input packets can crash the server entirely (worse than just injection).
**Root Cause:** The parsing code assumes well-formed input and doesn't handle edge cases like NULL pointers from `strtok()`.
**Fix Required:** Add comprehensive input validation and error handling to all parsing functions.

## Conclusion
Version 0.1 successfully demonstrates classic protocol vulnerabilities. It is not suitable for any production use but serves as an excellent learning tool for secure protocol design.
